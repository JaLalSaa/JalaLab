# 🧪 NΞRIX LAB

> Welcome to my personal **web dojo**, where I train, experiment, and evolve as a front-end developer.  
> Each folder is a unique project — from quick sketches to full components and interface prototypes.

## 🎯 About This Repository

This lab is my development ground — a growing collection of front-end projects, UI experiments, and design challenges.  
It's not about perfection. It's about iteration, creativity, and daily improvement.

- 💡 Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- 🎨 Experiments with layouts, animations, and UI patterns
- ⚔️ Inspired by real problems, tutorials, and spontaneous ideas

## 📁 Structure

Each folder is a standalone project with its own:
- `index.html`
- `style.css` or `master.css`
- Optional assets: images, icons, scripts

Some projects may be small, others more complex — all serve a purpose in my learning journey.
