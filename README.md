## 🎯 About This Repository

JalaLab is my creative playground — a collection of front-end projects, UI experiments, and coding challenges.  
It’s not about perfection but about iteration, creativity, and daily progress with a balanced and lively approach.

- 💡 Built mainly with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- 🎨 Focus on layouts, responsive design, animations, and user interface patterns  
- ⚔️ Inspired by real-world problems, tutorials, and spontaneous ideas  
- 🤖 Leveraged ChatGPT for guidance and improving code quality in some stages

## 📁 Structure

Each folder contains a standalone project with:  
- `index.html`  
- `style.css` (or `master.css`)  
- Optional assets like images, icons, or scripts

Projects vary from small practice sketches to more complex interfaces — all serve my ongoing learning journey.
